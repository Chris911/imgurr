Most of the time the delete hash gets lost if you don't have an account and you want to takedown an image you have to contact Imgur support which can take a while. With imgurr all your delete hashes are saved so you can delete your images later if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2.
